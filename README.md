# Creating Google Slides from Markdown

Here is my little script that will create a set of slides from Markdown. It's not a very good Markdown parser. In fact, I wouldn't call it a parser at all, but it does get the job done.

# For Development

I set up [clasp](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp) to make it easier to use my own editor instead of the web based editor. It is a Node.js app. Once it's set up you can use `clasp pull` to get the script and `clasp push` to push the updates.
